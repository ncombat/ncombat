I HAVE ADDED 6 SHIPS TO COMBAT, MAKING A TOTAL OF 15 SHIPS.
NOW TO SHOOT A MISSILE AT A GORN, ADD 20 TO THE GORN NUMBER.
EXAMPLE: TO SHOOT A MISSILE AT GORN BASE 1, DO #M21#...
THE MESSAGE SENDING COMMAND WORKS THE SAME FOR SHIPS 10-15...
TO SEND A PRIVATE MESSAGE TO SHIP 15, PUT #/15# AT THE BEGINNING OF
THE MESSAGE LINE.
SHIPS 10-15 ARE REPRESENTED THIS WAY ON THE MAP (I5) COMMAND:
   SHIP 10 = S+
   SHIP 11 = S-
   SHIP 12 = S*
   SHIP 13 = S/
   SHIP 14 = S(
   SHIP 15 = S)
THIS IS AN INHERENT BUG OF ADDING SHIPS TO COMBAT.

SEND TO: RSP IN MAIL FOR QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS.
THIS IS: OLD,COMINFO/UN=GAP0001.

AFTER SEEING THE HORRIBLE IMITATIONS OF THE ORIGINAL COMBAT
PROGRAM FROM THE MERITSS SYSTEM FORMERLY ON MUG0110,
I HAVE DECIDED TO PUT THE ORIGINAL COMBAT ON MECC AS A MULTI-TASK.
I'M SURE THAT EVERYONE WILL ENJOY THIS VERSION OF COMBAT MUCH MORE
THAN MCOMBAT OR DCOMBAT. AND IT IS UP NOW. NOT IN 4 WEEKS.
COMBAT STILL HAS SOME BUGS, THOUGH, BUT I FIX "EM AS SOON AS I
FIND "EM. IF YOU KNOW HOW TO #PREMATURE TASK ABORT.# COMBAT,
I WOULD APPRECIATE VERY MUCH IF YOU TOLD ME HOW, SO I CAN FIX
IT, SO COMBAT CAN BE A BETTER GAME FOR EVERYBODY...

I DO HAVE A #MONITOR MODE# IN COMBAT WHICH ALLOWS MONITORS
(ME AND A FEW FRIENDS) TO TAKE DOWN COMBAT, SEND SPECIAL MESSAGES
TO ALL PORTS, AND TO PURGE TROUBLESOME PEOPLE.
IF ANYONE SEEMS TO BE ABUSING THEIR MONITORING PRIVILAGES,
SEND ME A NOTE IN #MAIL#.
HERE IS THE INFO FILE:

COMBAT IV COMMAND EXPLANATOIN AND GAME NOTES

COMMANDS ARE -

A - ACCELERATE SHIP. AX,Y ACCELERATE FROM -5 TO 5 KM/SEC^2. (X)
    FROM 0 TO 300 SECONDS OF ACCELERATION. (Y) EX: A2,30 ACCELERATE
    AT 2 KM/SEC^2 FOR 30 SECONDS.
    FINAL SPEED = ACCELERATION * TIME OF ACCELERATION
    NEGATIVE VALUES OF ACELLERATION ALLOW YOU TO GO IN REVERSE.
    ONE KM/SEC^2 ACCELERATION COSTS 50 ENERGY UNITS.

B - TOGGLES BRIEF MODE ON AND OFF. WHEN IT IS ON, IT DELETES HEADERS
    TO SPEED PRINTOUT.

E - SEND MESSAGES. AFTER ISSUING "E" COMMAND, PROGRAM ASKS YOU
    TO ENTER MESSAGE. ONLY 69 CHARACTERS ARE SENT. NULL LINES
    (I.E. JUST A -CR-) SENDS NO MESSAGE. TO SEND TO JUST ONE PERSON
    TYPE:   /3 HI THERE. (WHERE 3 IS THE SHIP NUMBER YOU WANT
    TO RECEIVE PRIVATE MESSAGE.) OTHERWISE EVERYONE RECIEVES
    EVERYONE ELSE"S MESSAGES. MESSAGES ARE PRINTED AUTOMATICALLY.

F - FULL POWER TO BOTH SHIELDS. FASTER THAN DOING S1,25S2,25
    TO PUT POWER ON SHIELDS.

G - GRAVIMETRIC SENDOR RANGE ADJUSTMENT. GX  WHEN SIGNING ON, SENSOR
    RANGE IS 30000 KM. THIS COMMAND ALLOWS A PLAYER TO ALTER THE
    ********************** MISSING TEXT HERE ************************
    TAKES FOR PRINT OUT OF STATUS ON SHIPS.
    GORN DATA IS ALSO AFFECTED BY "G" RANGE. BE SURE TO SET UP THE "G"
    RANGE IF YOU CAN"T SEE ANY OTHER SHIP OR GORN.

H - GIVES A BRIEF LIST OF COMMANDS.

I - INTELLIGENCE COMMAND. IX,Y  HERE ARE THE SUBCOMMANDS:
    1. PRINT ROTATION AND SPEED TO ATTAIN A PARALLEL COURSE
       WITH SHIP N. EX: I1,3 WOULD PRINT:
       SP     ROT   SPD OR ROT   SPD
        3  -120.5    10.  59.5  -10.
       SINCE A SHIP CAN GO FORWARD OR REVERSE THE PLAYER HAS A
       CHOICE OF TURNING IN EITHER OF TWO DIRECTIONS AND USING THE
       APPROPRIATE ENGINE. SINCE 59.5 IS CLOSER, R59.5 IS ISSUED.
       AFTER ROTATION IS COMPLETE (ABOUT 10 SECONDS) A-5,2 IS ISSUED.
       THEN THE SHIPS WILL BE STATIONARY RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER.
       (NO MATTER WHAT ANGLES AND SPEEDS SHIPS HAD BEEN FLYING).
       ONCE PARALLEL, YOU CAN ROTATE YOUR SHIP TO ZERO THE AZIMUTH
       OF YOUR TARGET SHIP AND THEN FIRE, OR ACCELLERATE TO CLOSE IN ON IT.
    2. FIND RANGE AND ZIMUTH TO CENTER OF COMBAT ZONE. EX: I2
       PRINTS: AZ: 0180. RNG:   27034. TO CENTER
    3. PRINT OUT COMMANDERS NAME, TERMINAL NUMBER, USER NUMBER,
       AND KILLS OF SHIPS PRESENTLY ON.
       EX: I3,2 WOULD GIVE DATA ON SHIP 2 ONLY. I3 WOULD PRINT
       DATA ON ALL SHIPS.
    4. LIST OF LAST 30 USERS GIVING SHIP, STATUS, KILLS MADE,
       TERMINAL NUMBER, USERNUMBER, TIME ON, TIME OFF, AND
       COMMANDERS NAME.
       STATUS:     = STILL PLAYING
               HNG = SHIP HUNG UP HIS PHONE.
               LPR = SHIP LOST ALL POWER.
               DGN = SHIP DESTROYED BY GORN BASE N.
               DDS = SHIP SELF-DESTRUCTED.
               DDN = SHIP DESTROYED BY SHIP N.
               PUR = SHIP WAS PURGED BY A MONITOR.
    5. MAP OPTION. PRINTS MAP OF AREA OUT TO SENSOR RANGE.
       (15*15 SIZE.) SX=SHIP X, GX=GORN X. **=TWO OR MORE SHIPS WITHIN
       THAT SQUARE. ZERO DEGREES IS STRAIGHT UP. NEGATIVE DEGREES
       LEFT AND POSITIVE DEGREES RIGHTHAND SIDE.
    6. PRINTS DAMAGE ON, AZIMUTH TO, AND RANGE TO GORN BASES
       STILL ON, IF WITHIN RANGE SET BY "G" COMMAND. OR +OR- 15 DEGREES.
       
L - FIRE LASERS. LX  FIRE  0 TO 2000 ENERGY. SPREAD IS +OR- 1 DEG.
    LASERS HIT ALL TARGETS WITHIN SPREAD REGARDLESS OF RANGE.
    THE MORE POWER APPLIED TO LASERS, THE LONGER IT TAKES FOR
    THE LASERS TO COOL DOWN. THE EXACT EQUATION FOR TIME REQUIRED
    FOR LASERS TO COOL IS:  (POWER/40)+10
    EX: L1000 (1000/40)+10 = 35 SECONDS.
    DAMAGE CAUSED DEPENDS ON LASER POWER, RANGE TO TARGET, POWER ON
    SHIELD AND SHIELD HIT, SINCE SHIELD ?1 IS STRONGER THAN ?2.
    CD = COEFF. OF DAMAGE = (LASER POW * 12 * (33-SHIELD POW)/RANGE/1)/2
    HIT ON SHIELD ?1 CAUSES:
    CD PERCENT DAMAGE ON SHIELD ?1
    CD PERCENT DAMAGE ON SHIP ITSELF.
    HIT ON SHIELD ?2 CAUSES:
    CD*2 PERCENT DAMAGE ON SHIELD ?2
    CD PERCENT DAMAGE ON SHIP ITSELF.
    
M - FIRE MISSILE. MX,Y OR MX MY  2 TUBES AVAILABLE TO FIRE, COMPUTER
    FIRES TUBE(S) IF THEY ARE READY. IT TAKES 60 SECONDS TO LOAD A TUBE.
    RANGE OF MISSILES IS 20000 KM. SHIPS HAVE A MAXIMUM CAPACITY
    OF 25 MISSILES. MISSILES ARE RESTORED AFTER EVERY FIVE KILLS.
    MISSILES ARE NOT FIRED AT NON-EXISTANT SHIPS OR NON-EXISTANT GORNS.
    EX: M5 FIRES 1 MISSILE AT SHIP 5. IF TUBE 1 WERE NOT READY YET,
    COMPUTER WOULD FIRE TUBE 2 (PROVIDED IT WAS READY).
    FOR PURPOSES OF MISSILE TARGETTING, GORN BASES 1,2,3, _ 4
    ARE CONSIDERED TARGETS 21,22,23, AND 24, RESPECTIVELY.
    CD = COEFF. OF DAMAGE = (102 - (SHIELD POW. * 4))/2
    HIT ON SHIELD ?1 CAUSES:
    CD PERCENT DAMAGE TO SHIELD ?1
    CD PERCENT DAMAGE TO SHIP ITSELF.
    HIT ON SHIELD ?2 CAUSES:
    CD*2 PERCENT DAMAGE TO SHIELD ?2.
    CD PERCENT DAMAGE TO SHIP ITSELF.
    
N - NULL COMMAND. IF PLAYER WISHES TO GET THE LATEST INFORMATION
    ABOUT THE POSITION OF SHIPS, SHIPS DESTROYED, AND OTHER RELATED
    INFORMATION, AND HAVE USED ONLY THE B, C, E, G, OR I COMMANDS,
    USUALLY N, TO GET THE UPDATED INFORMATION.
    
P - DISTRIBUTE REPAIR RATE BETWEEN TWO SHIELDS A~D SHIP. PX,Y
    THE MAXIMUM RATE OF 1.5 PERCENT PER SECOND, CAN BE DISTRIBUTED
    IN ANY MATTER. PX,Y IS THE FORMAT. X=RATE ON SHIELD ?1.
    Y=RATE ON SHIELD ?2  SHIP GETS 1.5-X-Y. EX: P1,0 (OR P1) GIVES
    SHIELD ?1 1 PERCENT REPAIR PER SECOND. ABSENT PARAMETERS = 0.
    EX: P GIVES FULL REPAIR RATE TO SHIP. REPAIR AUTOMATICALLY
    STARTS 40 SECONDS AFTER DAMAGE OCCURS. REPAIR PREVIOUSLEY TAKING
    PLACE IS SYSPENDED AFTER DAMAGE OCCURS. REPAIR CONTINUES THROUGHOUT
    ANY ACTION OF YOURS HOWEVER.
    DISTRIBUTION IS INNITIALLY .5 PERCENT PER SHIELD AND SHIP.
    IT IS ADVISED TO KEEP REPAIR OFF BY STAGGERING MISSILES AND LASERS
    OR IF OUT OF MISSILE RANGE BY SHOOTING LASERS ABOUT 1000.
    
R - ROTATE SHIP. RX,Y  POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE ROTATION. 0 TO +OR- 360. (X)
    EX: R180 WILL ROTATE AT 6 DEG/SEC. WHICH WILL TAKE ABOUT 30 SECONDS.
    RATE OR ROTATION CAN ALSO BE VARIED. EX: R180,1 WILL ROTATE AT
    1 DEG/SEC INSTEAD OF 6 DEG/SEC. THIS WILL TAKE 180 SECONDS.
    MAXIMUM RATE OF ROTATION IS 6 DEG/SEC.
    
S - INDIVIDUAL SHIELD POWER ADJUSTMENT. SX,Y  FROM 0 TO 25 POWER/SEC.
	 EX: S1,13 SHIELD 1 TO POWER 13
	 EX: S2,25 SHIELD 2 TO POWER 25
	 EX: FS2 TURNS S1 AND S2 ON TO FULL AND THEN TURNS S2 OFF. FASTER
	 THAN S1,25. SHIELDS SNAP ON AUTOMATICALLY IF YOU SIGN ON WITHIN
	 20000 KM OF ANOTHER SHIP. THEIRS DO NOT DETECT YOU, HOWEVER.
	 
STOP - DESTRUCTS SHIP AND LOGS YOU OFF GAME. BUT ONLY IF YOU ARE
       AT LEAST 30000 KM. FROM THE NEAREST SHIP. THE ONLY OTHER WAYS
       OUT ARE THROUGH BEING DESTROYED BY SOMEONE OR SOMETHING ELSE,
       OR BY LOSING ALL POWER. (WHICH ISN'T HARD).
       
VX     TRACK SHIP X. THE ONLY DATA YOU WILL RECEIVE WILL BE THE
       GENERAL DATA FOR THE SHIP YOU ARE TRACKING (FIRST LINE),
       AND A LIST OF ALL EXISTING SHIPS AND THEIR COURSES
       TOWARD YOU (SECOND LINE), AND YOUR TWO DATA LINES.
       WHEN THE SHIP YOU ARE TRACKING IS DESTROYED, YOU GO OUT OF
       TRACKING MODE, AND BACK INTO NORMAL OUTPUT MODE.
       IF TRACKING WHILE NOT IN BRIEF MODE, THE SECOND LINE OF
       OUTPUT IS HEADED BY A #S HEADNG# ENTRY FOR ALL EXISTING SHIPS.
       
Z - ZERO POWER ON BOTH SHIELDS. USEFUL UTILITY COMMAND TO HELP
    CONSERVE SHIPS ENERGY.
    
CONCERNING HANGING UP THE PHONE:
I HAVE RIGGED IT SO THAT IF A PERSON HANGS UP THE PHONE,
THE PERSON WHO HIT HIM LAST GETS THE HUNG-UP PERSONS POWER,
AND CREDIT FOR KILLING THAT SHIP. THEREFORE, HANGING UP THE
PHONE NO LONGER CAN DEPRIVE SOME WORTHY SOUL OF A KILL AND ENERGY.

EACH SHIP HAS TWO SHIELDS. SHIELD ?1 COVERS THE AREA IN
FRONT OF A SHIP FROM +30 DEGREES AZIMUTH TO -30 DEGREES. SHIELD
?2 COVERS EVERYTHING ELSE.
EX: SHIP IS AT -34 DEGREES AZIMUTH. ENEMY SHIP WOULD HIT
SHIELD ?2 IF FIRED AT YOU. EX: SHIP AT 17 DEGREES AZIMUTH. SHIP
WOULD HIT SHIELD ?1 IF FIRED AT YOU.

THERE ARE 4 GORN BASES AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE COMBAT ZONE
THAT GUARD AGAINST INTRUDERS INTO GORN SPACE. ANYONE ENTERING
THIER SPACE IS SHOT AT UNTIL THE SHIP IS DESTROYED, OR THE GORN WITHIN
100000 KM IS DESTROYED. OR UNTIL YOU LEAVE GORN TERRITORY.
DESTROYED GORNS RE-APPEAR ONE HALF-HOUR AFTER THEY ARE DESTROYED.
THE RANGE OF GORN BLASTERS IS 100,000 KM.
DAMAGE TO GORNS IS CALCULATED DIFFERENTLY THAN DAMAGE TO SHIPS.
GORNS CAN FIRE IN ANY DIRECTION WITH EQUAL EASE, AND FIRE ONCE
EVERY 50 SECONDS. GORNS ARE 30000 KM AWAY FROM THEIR BORDERS.
GORN SPACE ENCIRCLES THE ENTIRE COMBAT ZONE. THE BOUNDARY IS
70000 KM. FROM THE CENTER, PLAYERS ARE WARNED AT GREATER THAN
60000 KM. WHEN THEY ARE NEAR GORN TERRITORY.

ENGINE HEAR BUILDS UP AS FOLLOWS:
HEAT = 35 * ACCELERATION * TIME. ACCELERATION IS IN KM/SEC^2.
HEAT DISSIPATES AT 20 DEGREES A SECOND. IF HEAT EXCEEDS 5000,
EACH SECOND HEAT IS ABOVE 5000 COSTS 50 ENERGY UNITS. IF HEAT
EXCEEDS 7999 ENGINES BLOW UP AND ARE USELESS. 10 PERCENT DAMAGE IS DONE
TO THE SHIP, WHICH STOPS REPAIR FOR 40 SECONDS.

DATA IS PRINTED OUT AS:

SP DMG P1 P2  SPEED COURSE AZMUTH  RANGE HEADING
* THIS MUCH FOR OWN SHIP *

SP = SHIP NUMBER
DMG = DAMAGE TO SHIP
P1 = POWER ON SHIELD ?1
P2 = POWER ON SHIELD ?2
SPEED = SPEED OF SHIP IN KM/SEC.
COURSE = FLIGHT ANGLE AWAY OR TOWARD YOUR SHIP .
   IF YOUR OWN SHIPS COURSE IS NOT EQUAL TO ZERO, IT MEANS
   YOU ARENT POINTING THE DIRECTION YOU ARE MOVING.
   180 OR -180 INDICATES YOU ARE POINTING OPPOSITE
   THE DIRECTION YOU ARE MOVING. TO REGAIN A 0 COURSE
   ANGLE, ROTATE -NEGATIVE- THE COURSE ANGLE.
   EX:  -136.5   SO: R136.5
   TO STOP THE MOVEMENT OF YOUR SHIP, YOU MUST ACCELERATE
   IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE INITIAL ACCELERATION.
   EX:   152.3  ADD 27.7 TO GET 180 THUS: R27.7
   OR R-152.3 WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO USE REVERSE ENGINES.
   OR DO I1,X COMMAND WHERE X IS YOUR SHIP NUMBER. IT WILL FIGURE
   OUT ALL THE ANGLES AND SPEEDS NEEDED. JUST ENTER THEM.
   REMEMBER TO WAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE ROTATED (UP TO 30 SECONDS)
   BEFORE ACCELERATING.
   THE COURSE OF ANOTHER SHIP INDICATES WHETHER IT IS
   COMING TOWARD YOU (0 COURSE ANGLE) OR MOVING AWAY (180
   OR -180). EX:  -27 MEANS THE OTHER SHIP WILL MOVE
   PAST YOU, EX: -.3 MEANS SHIP IS COMING ALMOST AT YOU.
AZIMUTH = ANGLE OFF LINE OF FIRE (FROM FRONT OF SHIP)
   EX: OWN COURSE IS ZERO, AZIMUTH TO SHIP IS -179  MEANS
   YOU ARE MOVING ALMOST DIRECTLY AWAY FROM SHIP 3, AND
   ARE UNABLE TO MAKE ANY HITS ON SHIP 3.
   EX: SHIP 5 IS AT RANGE 20300 AZIMUTH 137.2 AND YOU WISH
   TO HIT SHIP 5 WITH MISSILES. THUS:
   R137.2    THEN:   A1,30   A LITTLE LATER SHIP
   IS AT RANGE LESS THAN 20000 AND YOU CAN FIRE WITH MISSILES.
   BUT THEN SHIP 5 STARTS MOVING OFF AT HIGH SPEED, SO
   YOU USE THE I1,5 COMMAND TO PARALLEL SHIP 5 TO MAKE
   STATIONARY RELATIVE TO YOU....BY THIS TIME SHIP 5 HAS
   BEEN DESTROYED BY SHIP 9 AND SHIP 2 POPPED UP 5000 KM
   FROM YOU AND IS MAKING LIFE MISERABLE....
RANGE = DISTANCE TO SHIP IN KM.
HEADING = DIRECTION SHIP IS POINTING  (0 = AT YOU, 180 = AWAY FROM YOU)
   EX: SHIP 2 HAS HEADING OF 2.5 DEGREES. THIS MEANS THAT
   PLAYER 5 SEES THAT AZIMUTH TO YOU IS 2.5 AND
   IT JUST SO HAPPENS THE RANGE IS 18000 KM. SO HE DECIDES
   TO FIRE 2 MISSILES AT YOU.
   
DATA ABOUT YOUR OWN SHIP COMES BEFORE THE COMMAND INPUT REQUEST.

ENERGY DMG1 DMG2 T1/MI/T2 T3 ACCEL/TIM  DEG/TIM HEAT

ENERGY = ENERGY REMAINING
DMG1 = DAMAGE ON SHIELD ?1
DMG2 = DAMAGE TO SHIELD ?2
T1 = TIME TILL TUBE ONE IS LOADED AND READY TO FIRE
MI = NUMBER OF MISSILES REMAINING
T2 = TIME TILL TUBE TWO IS LOADED AND READY TO FIRE
T3 = TIME TILL LASER IS COOLED DOWN AND READY TO FIRE
ACEL = ACCELERATION IN KM/SEC^2 OF LAST ACCELERATION COMMAND
TIM = SECONDS LEFT TILL ACCELERATION IS COMPLETE
DEG = ANGLE LEFT TO ROTATE FOR LAST ROTATION COMMAND
TIM = SECONDS TILL ROTATION IS COMPLETE
HEAT = ENGINE HEAT

HIT INDICATIONS:
IF DAMAGE > 20 PERCENT
**BLAM** SHIP 1 LASER HIT SHIELD I CAUSED ?? DAMAGE.
**BLAM** ...MISSILE...

IF DAMAGE < 20 PERCENT
>>PWANG<< (IN PLACE OF **BLAM**)

COMMANDS AND THIER PARAMETERS CAN BE PLACED ON THE SAME INPUT LINE
IN COMBAT IV TO SPEED PLAY, AS CAN BE SEEN IN SOME EXAMPLES ABOVE.
EX: COMMANDS: A1,100P1L2000M1,1FS2
THIS LINE WOULD DO THE FOLLOWING:
A1,100  WOULD START ACCELERATION SHIP AT 1 KM/SEC^2
P1 DISTRIBUTES
