						A - ACCELERATE SHIP.
						AX,Y ACCELERATE FROM -5 TO 5 KM/SEC^2. (X)
							    FROM 0 TO 300 SECONDS OF ACCELERATION. (Y) EX: A2,30 ACCELERATE
							    AT 2 KM/SEC^2 FOR 30 SECONDS.
							    FINAL SPEED = ACCELERATION * TIME OF ACCELERATION
							    NEGATIVE VALUES OF ACELLERATION ALLOW YOU TO GO IN REVERSE.
							    ONE KM/SEC^2 ACCELERATION COSTS 50 ENERGY UNITS.
							    ACCLERATION GENERATES ENGINE HEAT.
							    ENGINE HEAT BUILDS UP AS FOLLOWS: 
							    	HEAT = 35 * ACCELERATION * TIME. 
									HEAT DISSIPATES AT 20 DEGREES A SECOND. 
									IF HEAT EXCEEDS 5000, EACH SECOND HEAT IS ABOVE 5000 COSTS 50 ENERGY UNITS. 
									IF HEAT EXCEEDS 7999 ENGINES BLOW UP AND ARE USELESS. 
									10 PERCENT DAMAGE IS DONE TO THE SHIP, WHICH STOPS REPAIR FOR 40 SECONDS.
							<br/><br/>
						R - ROTATE SHIP.
								RX,Y  POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE ROTATION. 0 TO +OR- 360. (X)
							    EX: R180 WILL ROTATE AT 6 DEG/SEC. WHICH WILL TAKE ABOUT 30 SECONDS.
							    RATE OR ROTATION CAN ALSO BE VARIED. EX: R180,1 WILL ROTATE AT
							    1 DEG/SEC INSTEAD OF 6 DEG/SEC. THIS WILL TAKE 180 SECONDS.
							    MAXIMUM RATE OF ROTATION IS 6 DEG/SEC.</p>
					<p id="a-weapons" class="help">
						L - FIRE LASERS. 
						LX  FIRE  0 TO 2000 ENERGY. SPREAD IS +OR- 1 DEG.
							    LASERS HIT ALL TARGETS WITHIN SPREAD REGARDLESS OF RANGE.
							    THE MORE POWER APPLIED TO LASERS, THE LONGER IT TAKES FOR
							    THE LASERS TO COOL DOWN. THE EXACT EQUATION FOR TIME REQUIRED
							    FOR LASERS TO COOL IS:  (POWER/40)+10
							    EX: L1000 (1000/40)+10 = 35 SECONDS.
							    DAMAGE CAUSED DEPENDS ON LASER POWER, RANGE TO TARGET, POWER ON
							    SHIELD AND SHIELD HIT, SINCE SHIELD ?1 IS STRONGER THAN ?2.
							    CD = COEFF. OF DAMAGE = (LASER POW * 12 * (33-SHIELD POW)/RANGE/1)/2
							    HIT ON SHIELD ?1 CAUSES:
							    CD PERCENT DAMAGE ON SHIELD ?1
							    CD PERCENT DAMAGE ON SHIP ITSELF.
							    HIT ON SHIELD ?2 CAUSES:
							    CD*2 PERCENT DAMAGE ON SHIELD ?2
							    CD PERCENT DAMAGE ON SHIP ITSELF.
						<br/><br/>
						M - FIRE MISSILE.
								MX,Y OR MX MY  2 TUBES AVAILABLE TO FIRE, COMPUTER
							    FIRES TUBE(S) IF THEY ARE READY. IT TAKES 60 SECONDS TO LOAD A TUBE.
							    RANGE OF MISSILES IS 20000 KM. SHIPS HAVE A MAXIMUM CAPACITY
							    OF 25 MISSILES. MISSILES ARE RESTORED AFTER EVERY FIVE KILLS.
							    MISSILES ARE NOT FIRED AT NON-EXISTANT SHIPS OR NON-EXISTANT GORNS.
							    EX: M5 FIRES 1 MISSILE AT SHIP 5. IF TUBE 1 WERE NOT READY YET,
							    COMPUTER WOULD FIRE TUBE 2 (PROVIDED IT WAS READY).
							    FOR PURPOSES OF MISSILE TARGETTING, GORN BASES 1,2,3, _ 4
							    ARE CONSIDERED TARGETS 21,22,23, AND 24, RESPECTIVELY.
							    CD = COEFF. OF DAMAGE = (102 - (SHIELD POW. * 4))/2
							    HIT ON SHIELD ?1 CAUSES:
							  	  CD PERCENT DAMAGE TO SHIELD ?1
								    CD PERCENT DAMAGE TO SHIP ITSELF.
							    HIT ON SHIELD ?2 CAUSES:
							    CD*2 PERCENT DAMAGE TO SHIELD ?2.
							    CD PERCENT DAMAGE TO SHIP ITSELF.</p>
					<p id="a-commands" class="help">
							B - TOGGLES BRIEF MODE ON AND OFF. 
							WHEN IT IS ON, IT DELETES HEADERS TO SPEED PRINTOUT.
							<br/><br/>
							E - SEND MESSAGES. 
							AFTER ISSUING "E" COMMAND, PROGRAM ASKS YOU
							    TO ENTER MESSAGE. ONLY 69 CHARACTERS ARE SENT. NULL LINES
							    (I.E. JUST A -CR-) SENDS NO MESSAGE. TO SEND TO JUST ONE PERSON
							    TYPE:   
							    	/3 HI THERE. 
							    (WHERE 3 IS THE SHIP NUMBER YOU WANT TO RECEIVE PRIVATE MESSAGE.) 
							    OTHERWISE EVERYONE RECIEVES EVERYONE ELSE"S MESSAGES. MESSAGES ARE PRINTED AUTOMATICALLY.
							    THE MESSAGE SENDING COMMAND WORKS THE SAME FOR SHIPS 10-15...
							    TO SEND A PRIVATE MESSAGE TO SHIP 15, PUT #/15# AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MESSAGE LINE.
							<br/><br/>
							F - FULL POWER TO BOTH SHIELDS.
							FASTER THAN DOING S1,25S2,25 TO PUT POWER ON SHIELDS.
							<br/><br/>
							G - GRAVIMETRIC SENDOR RANGE ADJUSTMENT. 
							GX  WHEN SIGNING ON, SENSOR RANGE IS 30000 KM. THIS COMMAND ALLOWS A PLAYER TO ALTER THE TAKES FOR PRINT OUT OF STATUS ON SHIPS. GORN DATA IS ALSO AFFECTED BY "G" RANGE. BE SURE TO SET UP THE "G" RANGE IF YOU CAN"T SEE ANY OTHER SHIP OR GORN.
							<br/><br/>
							H - GIVES A BRIEF LIST OF COMMANDS.
							<br/><br/>
							I - INTELLIGENCE COMMAND. IX,Y  
							HERE ARE THE SUBCOMMANDS:
							    1. PRINT ROTATION AND SPEED TO ATTAIN A PARALLEL COURSE
							       WITH SHIP N. EX: I1,3 WOULD PRINT:
							       SP     ROT   SPD OR ROT   SPD
							        3  -120.5    10.  59.5  -10.
							       SINCE A SHIP CAN GO FORWARD OR REVERSE THE PLAYER HAS A
							       CHOICE OF TURNING IN EITHER OF TWO DIRECTIONS AND USING THE
							       APPROPRIATE ENGINE. SINCE 59.5 IS CLOSER, R59.5 IS ISSUED.
							       AFTER ROTATION IS COMPLETE (ABOUT 10 SECONDS) A-5,2 IS ISSUED.
							       THEN THE SHIPS WILL BE STATIONARY RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER.
							       (NO MATTER WHAT ANGLES AND SPEEDS SHIPS HAD BEEN FLYING).
							       ONCE PARALLEL, YOU CAN ROTATE YOUR SHIP TO ZERO THE AZIMUTH
							       OF YOUR TARGET SHIP AND THEN FIRE, OR ACCELLERATE TO CLOSE IN ON IT.
							    2. FIND RANGE AND ZIMUTH TO CENTER OF COMBAT ZONE. EX: I2
							       PRINTS: AZ: 0180. RNG:   27034. TO CENTER
							    3. PRINT OUT COMMANDERS NAME, TERMINAL NUMBER, USER NUMBER,
							       AND KILLS OF SHIPS PRESENTLY ON.
							       EX: I3,2 WOULD GIVE DATA ON SHIP 2 ONLY. I3 WOULD PRINT
							       DATA ON ALL SHIPS.
							    4. LIST OF LAST 30 USERS GIVING SHIP, STATUS, KILLS MADE,
							       TERMINAL NUMBER, USERNUMBER, TIME ON, TIME OFF, AND
							       COMMANDERS NAME.
							       STATUS:     = STILL PLAYING
							               HNG = SHIP HUNG UP HIS PHONE.
							               LPR = SHIP LOST ALL POWER.
							               DGN = SHIP DESTROYED BY GORN BASE N.
							               DDS = SHIP SELF-DESTRUCTED.
							               DDN = SHIP DESTROYED BY SHIP N.
							               PUR = SHIP WAS PURGED BY A MONITOR.
							    5. MAP OPTION. PRINTS MAP OF AREA OUT TO SENSOR RANGE.
							       (15*15 SIZE.) SX=SHIP X, GX=GORN X. **=TWO OR MORE SHIPS WITHIN
							       THAT SQUARE. ZERO DEGREES IS STRAIGHT UP. NEGATIVE DEGREES
							       LEFT AND POSITIVE DEGREES RIGHTHAND SIDE.
							       SHIPS 10-15 ARE REPRESENTED THIS WAY:
						   				SHIP 10 = S+
									    SHIP 11 = S-
						   				SHIP 12 = S*
						   				SHIP 13 = S/
						   				SHIP 14 = S(
						   				SHIP 15 = S)
							    6. PRINTS DAMAGE ON, AZIMUTH TO, AND RANGE TO GORN BASES
							       STILL ON, IF WITHIN RANGE SET BY "G" COMMAND. OR +OR- 15 DEGREES.
							   <br/><br/> 
							N - NULL COMMAND.
									 IF PLAYER WISHES TO GET THE LATEST INFORMATION
							    ABOUT THE POSITION OF SHIPS, SHIPS DESTROYED, AND OTHER RELATED
							    INFORMATION, AND HAVE USED ONLY THE B, C, E, G, OR I COMMANDS,
							    USUALLY N, TO GET THE UPDATED INFORMATION.
							    <br/><br/> 
							P - DISTRIBUTE REPAIR RATE BETWEEN TWO SHIELDS AND SHIP.
								 PX,Y
							    THE MAXIMUM RATE OF 1.5 PERCENT PER SECOND, CAN BE DISTRIBUTED
							    IN ANY MATTER. PX,Y IS THE FORMAT. X=RATE ON SHIELD ?1.
							    Y=RATE ON SHIELD ?2  SHIP GETS 1.5-X-Y. EX: P1,0 (OR P1) GIVES
							    SHIELD ?1 1 PERCENT REPAIR PER SECOND. ABSENT PARAMETERS = 0.
							    EX: P GIVES FULL REPAIR RATE TO SHIP. REPAIR AUTOMATICALLY
							    STARTS 40 SECONDS AFTER DAMAGE OCCURS. REPAIR PREVIOUSLEY TAKING
							    PLACE IS SYSPENDED AFTER DAMAGE OCCURS. REPAIR CONTINUES THROUGHOUT
							    ANY ACTION OF YOURS HOWEVER.
							    DISTRIBUTION IS INNITIALLY .5 PERCENT PER SHIELD AND SHIP.
							    IT IS ADVISED TO KEEP REPAIR OFF BY STAGGERING MISSILES AND LASERS
							    OR IF OUT OF MISSILE RANGE BY SHOOTING LASERS ABOUT 1000.
							   <br/><br/> 
							S - INDIVIDUAL SHIELD POWER ADJUSTMENT.
							SX,Y  FROM 0 TO 25 POWER/SEC.
								 EX: S1,13 SHIELD 1 TO POWER 13
								 EX: S2,25 SHIELD 2 TO POWER 25
								 EX: FS2 TURNS S1 AND S2 ON TO FULL AND THEN TURNS S2 OFF. FASTER
								 THAN S1,25. SHIELDS SNAP ON AUTOMATICALLY IF YOU SIGN ON WITHIN
								 20000 KM OF ANOTHER SHIP. THEIRS DO NOT DETECT YOU, HOWEVER.
								 <br/><br/> 
							STOP - DESTRUCTS SHIP AND LOGS YOU OFF GAME. 
							BUT ONLY IF YOU ARE AT LEAST 30000 KM. FROM THE NEAREST SHIP. THE ONLY OTHER WAYS OUT ARE THROUGH BEING DESTROYED BY SOMEONE OR SOMETHING ELSE, OR BY LOSING ALL POWER. (WHICH ISN'T HARD).
							       I HAVE RIGGED IT SO THAT IF A PERSON <strike>HANGS UP THE PHONE,</strike> DISCONNECTS, THE PERSON WHO HIT HIM LAST GETS THE HUNG-UP PERSONS POWER, AND CREDIT FOR KILLING THAT SHIP. THEREFORE, HANGING UP THE PHONE NO LONGER CAN DEPRIVE SOME WORTHY SOUL OF A KILL AND ENERGY.
							   <br/><br/> 
							VX TRACK SHIP X. 
							       GENERAL DATA FOR THE SHIP YOU ARE TRACKING (FIRST LINE),
							       AND A LIST OF ALL EXISTING SHIPS AND THEIR COURSES
							       TOWARD YOU (SECOND LINE), AND YOUR TWO DATA LINES.
							       WHEN THE SHIP YOU ARE TRACKING IS DESTROYED, YOU GO OUT OF
							       TRACKING MODE, AND BACK INTO NORMAL OUTPUT MODE.
							       IF TRACKING WHILE NOT IN BRIEF MODE, THE SECOND LINE OF
							       OUTPUT IS HEADED BY A #S HEADNG# ENTRY FOR ALL EXISTING SHIPS.
							       
							Z - ZERO POWER ON BOTH SHIELDS. 
							USEFUL UTILITY COMMAND TO HELP CONSERVE SHIPS ENERGY.
					</p>
					<p id="a-shields" class="help">
						EACH SHIP HAS TWO SHIELDS. SHIELD ?1 COVERS THE AREA IN
						FRONT OF A SHIP FROM +30 DEGREES AZIMUTH TO -30 DEGREES. SHIELD
						?2 COVERS EVERYTHING ELSE.
						EX: SHIP IS AT -34 DEGREES AZIMUTH. ENEMY SHIP WOULD HIT
						SHIELD ?2 IF FIRED AT YOU. EX: SHIP AT 17 DEGREES AZIMUTH. SHIP

						P1 = POWER ON SHIELD ?1
						P2 = POWER ON SHIELD ?2
						SPEED = SPEED OF SHIP IN KM/SEC.
						COURSE = FLIGHT ANGLE AWAY OR TOWARD YOUR SHIP .
						   IF YOUR OWN SHIPS COURSE IS NOT EQUAL TO ZERO, IT MEANS
						   YOU ARENT POINTING THE DIRECTION YOU ARE MOVING.
						   180 OR -180 INDICATES YOU ARE POINTING OPPOSITE
						   THE DIRECTION YOU ARE MOVING. TO REGAIN A 0 COURSE
						   ANGLE, ROTATE -NEGATIVE- THE COURSE ANGLE.
						   EX:  -136.5   SO: R136.5
						   TO STOP THE MOVEMENT OF YOUR SHIP, YOU MUST ACCELERATE
						   IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE INITIAL ACCELERATION.
						   EX:   152.3  ADD 27.7 TO GET 180 THUS: R27.7
						   OR R-152.3 WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO USE REVERSE ENGINES.
						   OR DO I1,X COMMAND WHERE X IS YOUR SHIP NUMBER. IT WILL FIGURE
						   OUT ALL THE ANGLES AND SPEEDS NEEDED. JUST ENTER THEM.
						   REMEMBER TO WAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE ROTATED (UP TO 30 SECONDS)
						   BEFORE ACCELERATING.
						   THE COURSE OF ANOTHER SHIP INDICATES WHETHER IT IS
						   COMING TOWARD YOU (0 COURSE ANGLE) OR MOVING AWAY (180
						   OR -180). EX:  -27 MEANS THE OTHER SHIP WILL MOVE
						   PAST YOU, EX: -.3 MEANS SHIP IS COMING ALMOST AT YOU.
						AZIMUTH = ANGLE OFF LINE OF FIRE (FROM FRONT OF SHIP)
						   EX: OWN COURSE IS ZERO, AZIMUTH TO SHIP IS -179  MEANS
						   YOU ARE MOVING ALMOST DIRECTLY AWAY FROM SHIP 3, AND
						   ARE UNABLE TO MAKE ANY HITS ON SHIP 3.
						   EX: SHIP 5 IS AT RANGE 20300 AZIMUTH 137.2 AND YOU WISH
						   TO HIT SHIP 5 WITH MISSILES. THUS:
						   R137.2    THEN:   A1,30   A LITTLE LATER SHIP
						   IS AT RANGE LESS THAN 20000 AND YOU CAN FIRE WITH MISSILES.
						   BUT THEN SHIP 5 STARTS MOVING OFF AT HIGH SPEED, SO
						   YOU USE THE I1,5 COMMAND TO PARALLEL SHIP 5 TO MAKE
						   STATIONARY RELATIVE TO YOU....BY THIS TIME SHIP 5 HAS
						   BEEN DESTROYED BY SHIP 9 AND SHIP 2 POPPED UP 5000 KM
						   FROM YOU AND IS MAKING LIFE MISERABLE....
						RANGE = DISTANCE TO SHIP IN KM.
						HEADING = DIRECTION SHIP IS POINTING  (0 = AT YOU, 180 = AWAY FROM YOU)
						   EX: SHIP 2 HAS HEADING OF 2.5 DEGREES. THIS MEANS THAT
						   PLAYER 5 SEES THAT AZIMUTH TO YOU IS 2.5 AND
						   IT JUST SO HAPPENS THE RANGE IS 18000 KM. SO HE DECIDES
						   TO FIRE 2 MISSILES AT YOU.

					<p id="a-gorns" class="help">
						THERE ARE 4 GORN BASES AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE COMBAT ZONE
						THAT GUARD AGAINST INTRUDERS INTO GORN SPACE. ANYONE ENTERING
						THIER SPACE IS SHOT AT UNTIL THE SHIP IS DESTROYED, OR THE GORN WITHIN
						100000 KM IS DESTROYED. OR UNTIL YOU LEAVE GORN TERRITORY.
						DESTROYED GORNS RE-APPEAR ONE HALF-HOUR AFTER THEY ARE DESTROYED.
						THE RANGE OF GORN BLASTERS IS 100,000 KM.
						DAMAGE TO GORNS IS CALCULATED DIFFERENTLY THAN DAMAGE TO SHIPS.
						GORNS CAN FIRE IN ANY DIRECTION WITH EQUAL EASE, AND FIRE ONCE
						EVERY 50 SECONDS. GORNS ARE 30000 KM AWAY FROM THEIR BORDERS.
						GORN SPACE ENCIRCLES THE ENTIRE COMBAT ZONE. THE BOUNDARY IS
						70000 KM. FROM THE CENTER, PLAYERS ARE WARNED AT GREATER THAN
						60000 KM. WHEN THEY ARE NEAR GORN TERRITORY.
						
						NOW TO SHOOT A MISSILE AT A GORN, ADD 20 TO THE GORN NUMBER.
						EXAMPLE: TO SHOOT A MISSILE AT GORN BASE 1, DO #M21#...
