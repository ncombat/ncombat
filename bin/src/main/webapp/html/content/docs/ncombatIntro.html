<h1>Welcome to ncombat</h1>
	<p>ncombat is an effort to re-develop the mainframe game mu,combat as it
	appeared on the MECC mainframe in the 1970s and early 1980s. Though we
	do not have original source code, we do have the player documentation and
	original thermal paper printouts.</p> 
	<p>Project goals include:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Keep interface simple - emphasis on text-only.</li>
		<li>Keep command and player interaction as close to original as possible.</li>
	</ol>
	The ncombat development project is hosted on
